# SweetBite Complete Order Flow Implementation

This document outlines the complete order flow implementation for the SweetBite cake ordering system, including shipping, payment, and order management.

## 🚀 Complete Order Flow

### 1. Cart → Shipping Address → Payment → Order Success

The complete flow follows this sequence:

1. **Shopping Cart** (`/cart`)
   - Users add cakes to cart
   - Click "Proceed to Checkout" → redirects to `/shipping-address`

2. **Shipping Address** (`/shipping-address`)
   - Users select existing address or add new one
   - Click "Proceed to Payment" → redirects to `/payment`

3. **Payment** (`/payment`)
   - Users choose payment method (Card, PayPal, Cash on Delivery)
   - Complete payment → redirects to `/order-success`

4. **Order Success** (`/order-success`)
   - Shows order confirmation and shipping status
   - Links to "My Orders" and "Continue Shopping"

### 2. My Orders Section (`/orders`)

- **Signed-in users** can view all their past orders
- **Real-time shipping updates** with status timeline
- **Order details** including items, shipping address, and payment info
- **Expandable order cards** for better UX

### 3. Admin Order Management (`/admin/orders`)

- **Staff can update shipping status** for any order
- **Real-time status updates** with notes
- **Order timeline tracking** for complete audit trail
- **Bulk order management** with status filtering

## 🏗️ Backend Architecture

### New Models Added

#### ShippingAddress
```python
class ShippingAddress(models.Model):
    customer = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    address_line1 = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    address_line2 = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    state = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='United States')
    is_default = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

#### Payment
```python
class Payment(models.Model):
    order = models.OneToOneField(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    payment_method = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=PAYMENT_METHOD)
    payment_status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=PAYMENT_STATUS)
    transaction_id = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    currency = models.CharField(max_length=3, default='USD')
    payment_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
    failure_reason = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

### API Endpoints
