# Manual Ingredient Deduction Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a manual ingredient deduction feature that allows inventory managers to manually decrease ingredient amounts from the inventory page. These deductions are tracked in the system and appear in the Weekly Usage Comparison analytics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/inventory/ingredients/{pk}/deduct_stock/`

**Features**:
- ✅ Permission checks (admin, inventory_manager, or staff_member only)
- ✅ Input validation (positive amounts, sufficient stock)
- ✅ Decimal precision handling for accurate calculations
- ✅ Stock movement record creation
- ✅ Automatic stock level update
- ✅ Detailed response with before/after stock levels

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "amount": 2.5,
  "reason": "Used for order"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully deducted 2.5 kg from Flour",
  "ingredient": {
    "id": 30,
    "name": "Flour",
    "current_stock": "43.300",
    "unit": "kg",
    ...
  },
  "deduction": {
    "amount": 2.5,
    "unit": "kg",
    "previous_stock": 45.8,
    "new_stock": 43.3
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend Implementation

**Location**: `/Users/vaishu/Desktop/sweetbites/src/pages/InventoryDashboard.js`

**UI Components Added**:

1. **Minus Button**:
   - Located next to the "Edit" button in the ingredients table
   - Orange color theme to indicate deduction action
   - Shows MinusIcon for visual clarity

2. **Deduction Modal**:
   - Clean, user-friendly interface
   - Displays ingredient details (name, current stock, unit cost)
   - Amount input field with:
     - Min: 0.01
     - Max: Current stock level
     - Step: 0.01 for precise measurements
     - Shows estimated cost based on unit cost
   - Reason dropdown with predefined options:
     - Used for order
     - Used for testing
     - Used for sampling
     - Damaged/Expired
     - Other
   - Real-time validation
   - Cancel and Deduct buttons

**State Management**:
```javascript
const [showDeductStock, setShowDeductStock] = useState(false);
const [deductingIngredient, setDeductingIngredient] = useState(null);
const [deductionFormData, setDeductionFormData] = useState({
  amount: '',
  reason: ''
});
```

**Key Functions**:
- `handleDeductStock(ingredient)`: Opens modal for selected ingredient
- `handleProcessDeduction(e)`: Processes the deduction via API

### 3. Stock Movement Tracking

All manual deductions are automatically recorded in the `StockMovement` table with:
- **Movement Type**: `out`
- **Reference**: `MANUAL-{timestamp}`
- **Notes**: `Manual deduction: {reason}`
- **Created By**: Current user
- **Timestamp**: Current date/time

**Example Stock Movement Record**:
```json
{
  "id": 220,
  "movement_type": "out",
  "quantity": "2.500",
  "previous_stock": "45.800",
  "new_stock": "43.300",
  "unit_cost": "2.50",
  "total_value": "6.25",
  "reference": "MANUAL-20251019115227",
  "notes": "Manual deduction: Used for order",
  "created_by": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    ...
  },
  "created_at": "2025-10-19T11:52:27.774504Z"
}
```

## Integration with Analytics

### Weekly Usage Comparison
- Manual deductions are included in the weekly usage analytics
- They appear alongside automatic deductions from orders
- Show up in the "Weekly Usage Comparison" chart on the inventory dashboard
- Help track actual ingredient consumption over time

### How It Works
1. User clicks "Minus" button next to an ingredient
2. Modal opens with ingredient details
3. User enters deduction amount and selects reason
4. System validates the input:
   - Ensures amount is positive
   - Checks sufficient stock available
   - Requires a reason to be selected
5. API processes the deduction:
   - Updates ingredient stock level
   - Creates stock movement record
   - Returns updated data
6. Frontend updates the display:
   - Shows success message
   - Updates ingredient list
   - Refreshes analytics data

## Testing Results

✅ **Backend API**: Successfully tested with curl
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/inventory/ingredients/30/deduct_stock/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 2.5, "reason": "Used for order"}'
```

✅ **Stock Movements**: Verified deductions appear in stock movement history

✅ **Weekly Analytics**: Confirmed deductions are tracked in weekly usage comparison

✅ **Frontend**: No linting errors
